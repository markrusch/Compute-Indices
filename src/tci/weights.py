"""Data-driven weight determination (methodology-hashed: changes require a version bump).

Pure functions — no database access. Three mechanisms, all standard index procedure:

1. Scheduled weight reviews (the mechanism commodity indices use for annual/periodic
   reweighting, here weekly): provider weights are recomputed on a fixed schedule from
   a trailing observation window and held constant between reviews. A provider's review
   weight = median over its observed days of (daily qualifying capacity x tier
   multiplier), scaled by its presence ratio (days observed / collection days in the
   window). No discretion anywhere in the path.
2. Concentration cap: at print time no constituent may exceed a configured share of
   total weight; the excess is redistributed pro-rata over the uncapped constituents,
   iterated to a fixed point. Final weights are expressed as shares summing to 100.
3. Chain linking for the composite (EU-CRI-COMPUTE): a chained Laspeyres-style index
   over class sub-indices, so scheduled reweights shift influence without ever jumping
   the published level.
