"""Normalisation to the reference unit (methodology-hashed: changes require a version bump).

Input: raw observation rows (sqlite Rows or dicts). Output: **one NormalisedObs per
surviving offer** — v0.3.0 aggregates over offers, not over one representative price per
provider, so nothing is collapsed here.

Two v0.3.0 changes carry most of the weight:

1. `filters.min_gpu_count` is 2, not 8. The 8-GPU floor passed 1 of 10 vast.ai collection
   days and discarded every marketplace offer — i.e. all of the index's price discovery.
   Measured within-venue on one day, the per-GPU discount saturates at 2 GPUs
   (1x=1.000, 2x=0.951, 4x=0.916, 8x=0.916), so 2/4/8 are comparable within ~4% and need
   no factor, while the 1-GPU small-order premium (~9%) is excluded rather than assumed away.

2. Variants are no longer normalised into a class by assumed factors. A class prices its
   reference variant only. H100 SXM and H100 PCIe are different products and are priced as
   different classes.

Currency: a row may be quoted in a currency other than USD (Scaleway quotes EUR). The
native amount is authoritative and conversion happens HERE, at print time, with the print's
FX rate — never frozen into the stored observation. Without a usable rate the row is
dropped rather than guessed.
