"""RunPod public GraphQL (no auth) — secure-cloud executable per-GPU rates.

Collection scope (SOURCES.md): secure cloud only; community tier is outside the index
universe. RunPod's secure-cloud pricing is region-flat and deliverable from its EU
secure-cloud datacenters (EU-RO / EU-SE / EU-NL); observations are recorded against
EU-RO by convention (documented — the API exposes no per-region price).

Schema verified against a live response on 2026-07-18 and re-verified 2026-09-04:
gpuTypes[].securePrice is the secure-cloud on-demand $/GPU-hr, and
lowestPrice(input:{gpuCount:N}).stockStatus demonstrates availability at node size N.
If the endpoint ever requires auth, this collector is retired — no workarounds.

NODE SIZE: probed at 8, 4 and 2 GPUs in a single request (aliased fields), and the
LARGEST size that actually demonstrates stock is recorded. Until 2026-09-04 this
collector probed only gpuCount:8 — a leftover from before v0.3.0 lowered
`filters.min_gpu_count` from 8 to 2. When RunPod had no 8-GPU pod the collector
recorded gpu_count=None, and normalise.py dropped the row ("executable asks must
demonstrably state their size") even though the price was in hand. Measured over the
modern collector regime that accounted for 7 of 8 headline gaps. Verified live on
2026-09-04: H100_SXM was 8x=none, 4x=Low, 2x=Medium on a day the index gapped.

1 GPU is deliberately NOT probed. v0.3.0 measured a ~9% small-order premium on 1-GPU
offers and excludes them rather than normalising them away; probing 1 would admit
exactly what `min_gpu_count: 2` exists to keep out.
