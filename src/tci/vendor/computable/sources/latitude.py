"""Latitude.sh -- bare-metal GPU plan blobs (Next.js flight data), all plans.

Observatory generalization of the basket lane's parse_latitude (pinned to
the single g4-b300 plan there; that recipe is untouched): this collector
iterates EVERY bare-metal plan blob in the flight data and records the ones
with a real GPU spec -- hourly (on-demand) AND monthly-commit tiers, per
region, in EVERY currency the page publishes. Prices are per NODE; the
per-GPU normalization divides by the plan's own stated gpu count
(gpu_count_basis) and, for the monthly tier, by latitude's 730 hours/month
convention (basket-proven).

Shape verified live 2026-08-22:
  - plan blobs sit in escaped flight JSON as slug/name pairs with the slug
    FIRST -- that field order is the discriminator: the vm-* virtual-machine
    entities publish name-first (and carry gpu null), and country/location
    entities never pair slug directly with name;
  - CPU-only bare-metal plans carry an EMPTY gpu object -- skipped. A
    non-empty gpu object the strict spec regex cannot read is a reshape and
    RAISES rather than silently dropping a GPU plan from the record;
  - each region row carries stock_level plus a pricing map of per-currency
    {hour, month, year} triples -- USD and BRL today, and BRL is latitude's
    own separately-set list price (5.5x USD on g3-h100-small vs 5.0x on the
    g4 plans), not an FX echo, so it is recorded natively via currency=;
  - an unavailable region publishes null/0 prices (United Kingdom on
    g4-rtx6kpro-large today): null/0 = tier not offered, skipped, never a
    $0 print. A priced region can still be stock_level "unavailable"
    (published list price; stock is metadata, recorded in extra);
  - each region row also carries, between its name anchor and its
    stock_level: deploys_instantly (OS slugs deployable instantly),
    locations.available (site codes where the plan can deploy at all) and
    locations.in_stock (site codes with inventory right now) -- recorded
    VERBATIM in extra. Site-level beats region-level: live SUBSET cases
    exist where a region is priced and stocked but only some of its sites
    hold inventory. These are availability METADATA, never a price gate:
    a missing/reshaped locations map or deploys list notes a
    partial_error and the priced observation still records (stock_level
    stays the primary region-shape tripwire). The apparent rules
    (site-in-in_stock inherits the region grade; empty deploys_instantly
    co-occurs with "unavailable") are correlation, not contract -- raw
    fields only, derive nothing.

The yearly figure in the pricing triple is deliberately NOT recorded as a
tier -- the lane config's contract for this source is hourly +
monthly-commit, and the year price is derivable from a future catalog
decision, not lost (raw flight data keeps publishing it).
