"""Hyperstack -- gpu-pricing page, all three price tables, tiers labeled.

Widens the basket lane's B200/B300-only hyperstack recipe (parse_hyperstack
in gpu_index.index.sources -- separate module, separate fetch; the basket recipe is
untouched) to every GPU on the page. Same HTML->pipe-text transform. The
prior art's exactly-3-numeric-spec-fields fence is KEPT for the on-demand
rows -- it is what excludes rows that lack the per-GPU spec columns; do not
loosen it. The two spec-less tables get their own fences: reservation rows
are pinned by their trailing 'Reserve here' link cell, spot rows by the
section slice between the spot column header and the CPU-pricing header.

Page shape verified live 2026-08-22 (each table rendered exactly once):

  'On-Demand GPU Pricing'  GPU Model | VRAM (GB) | Max pCPUs per GPU |
                           Max RAM (GB) per GPU | Pricing Per Hour
                                                      -> tier on-demand
  'Reservation Pricing'    GPU Model | Starting from | Reserve
                                                      -> tier reserved
  'Spot VM Pricing'        GPU Model | Spot VM        -> tier spot

Prices are USD per GPU per hour (the spec columns are explicit per-GPU
shares), so gpu_count_basis stays 1 and price*basis reproduces the raw
cell. The reservation figure is a 'Starting from' floor, flagged in
notes/extra. Nav and footer carry priceless lookalike labels (GB200 NVL72,
GB300 NVL72, HGX B200...) that must never print -- every fence requires a
price cell inside its own section slice. Section anchors are required
UNIQUE and in page order; a missing or duplicated anchor raises rather
than guessing (a second render of a table would otherwise double-print
every row; a renamed header would silently lose a tier's history).

Second, FAIL-OPEN fetch (availability accrual, live 2026-08-25 20:15Z):
STOCK_URL is a public stock endpoint published by Hyperstack -- per
region (US-1/CANADA-1/NORWAY-1) x per GPU
model (separate '-spot' models), a saturated 'available' GPU-count floor,
planned 7/30/100-day stock, and deployable VM counts per configuration
size (1x/2x/4x/8x/10x). Recorded VERBATIM, snapshot-level, in
book_stats["gpu_stock"] -- never joined onto the price rows: stock uses
flavor-family names (H100-80G-PCIe / H100-80G-PCIe-NVLink / B200-SXM)
while the price tables use marketing labels, and collectors never claim
a sku; the stock regions are real datacenters while the price rows keep
the coarser 'EU-heavy' constant. Downstream join keys: model token,
'-spot' suffix -> tier=spot, region. Semantics pinned live 2026-08-25:
'available' is a never-over-reported FLOOR string ("0", "3", "10+",
"100+") that saturates and can disagree with configurations (live:
H100-80G-PCIe available "1" but 1x:2) -- never int() it; planned_*_days
are nullable strings (usually null, sometimes "0"); model lists are
sparse per region (US-1 published only A100-80G-SXM4) so ABSENCE of a
model is not zero stock -- only explicit "0" rows are zeros. The stock
endpoint is not a contractual API: it can change or stop answering
any day, so parse_gpu_stock fences fail closed WITHIN the stock parse
and collect() converts any stock fetch/shape failure into a
partial_error tripwire -- stock death can NEVER dark the price lane.
