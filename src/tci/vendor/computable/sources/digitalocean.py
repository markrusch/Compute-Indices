"""DigitalOcean -- docs GPU Droplet pricing page, On-Demand + Spot tables.

One fetch of the server-rendered docs page (Hugo, prices in the raw bytes,
no JS needed). The docs page is DELIBERATELY the source over the marketing
page (www.digitalocean.com/pricing/gpu-droplets): the marketing page
interleaves '12 Month Reserved Price*' teasers ($3.26 H100, $7.94 B300)
with on-demand figures in a JS-heavy blob, while the docs page separates
tiers into cleanly anchored sections. The collector sends the project
User-Agent defined in gpu_index.common.http.

Page shape verified live 2026-08-22 (11 on-demand + 8 spot rows):

  - tier attribution comes ONLY from the section heading anchors, pinned
    fail-closed: for each of (on-demand-gpu-droplet-pricing -> on-demand,
    spot-gpu-droplet-pricing -> spot) the literal '<h2 id="...">' tag must
    appear exactly once, the slice runs to the NEXT '<h[2-4] id=' heading
    (refusing an unterminated slice), and the slice must hold exactly one
    <table> whose <th> cells are exactly GPU|Price. The third table
    (contract-gpu-droplet-pricing) publishes 'Per contract after contacting
    sales' instead of numbers and is never sliced; the same page's CPU
    pricing section and bandwidth prose ($0.01/GiB) are excluded the same
    way. The spot section is a public preview whose prices 'may change
    daily based on available idle GPU capacity' (page's own caveat, fine
    for slotted capture) -- the widely quoted $11.19 B300 is THIS tier;
    on-demand B300 is contract-only with no published number and must
    never be recorded;
  - row fences: a data row must carry exactly 2 <td> (else the label->
    price binding is suspect and the parse raises); a label cell that does
    not start 'NVIDIA '/'AMD ' is skipped + counted (a new vendor prefix
    is recorded as a visible partial error, never guessed); a price cell
    must fullmatch '$D[.DD] per hour' -- digit-free text (a contact-sales
    cell migrating in) is skipped + counted, digit-bearing text that
    misses the pin raises (a currency/format change is never guessed into
    USD). A section whose table yields zero observations raises even when
    every row was individually skippable;
  - prices are whole-droplet hourly rates in USD (the $ literal is part of
    the price pin); per-GPU normalization divides by the GPU count the
    page itself states in the label -- '(8x)' rows are 8-GPU droplets,
    unsuffixed rows are single-GPU. The multiplier is parsed generically
    ('(Nx)' -> N, label-final) so a new droplet size records its stated
    basis; a '(Nx)' token that is NOT label-final (footnote marker or
    suffix drift) makes the basis unbindable and the row is skipped +
    counted rather than defaulted to a 1-GPU basis. Every
    (8x) price is exactly 8x its 1x row today but that is NOT enforced --
    the page publishes both figures independently (spot repricing could
    diverge them) and each is recorded as printed;
  - label gotchas, all kept verbatim in sku_identifier (the catalog
    normalizes downstream): 'NVIDIA L40s' has a lowercase s; 'NVIDIA B300,
    air-cooled' and ', liquid-cooled' are distinct rows at the same price
    (both recorded, never deduped); 'NVIDIA RTX 4000'/'NVIDIA RTX 6000'
    omit 'Ada' although DO's marketing page names them RTX 4000 Ada /
    RTX 6000 Ada -- the bare labels normalize to the catalog's
    generation-AMBIGUOUS RTX_6000/RTX_4000 bucket skus (a deliberate
    catalog rule: never guess a generation from a bare label), resolved
    in config, never patched here;
  - per-tier chip sets differ by design (MI350X/MI355X spot-only, MI300X/
    MI325X on-demand-only today) -- rows are recorded per section, never
    joined across tables.

No pagination; a single static page per capture.
