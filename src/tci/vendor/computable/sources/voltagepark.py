"""Voltage Park -- unauthenticated dashboard locations API, both network tiers.

Price surface: GET https://cloud-api.voltagepark.com/api/v1/bare-metal/locations
(the SPA dashboard's logged-out variant; no auth, no cookies). Verified live
2026-08-22, re-verified byte-identical 2026-08-25: results[] holds one
location row keyed by specs_per_node.gpu_model ('h100-sxm5-80gb', 8x per
node) with TWO published per-GPU hourly prices -- gpu_price_ethernet
("1.99") and gpu_price_infiniband ("2.49") -- as decimal strings. Both
are networking variants of the same ON-DEMAND product (ethernet
vs 3200Gbps InfiniBand), NOT an on-demand/reserved split (long-term reserve is
contact-only and never published), so tier stays "on-demand" for both and the
voltagepark-native ``network`` label lives in extra -- same vocabulary rule as
the runpod exemplar's secure/community clouds.

Basis and currency facts (why the fields mean what we record):

  - prices are per GPU per HOUR: the dashboard app multiplies by gpuCount to
    build a total (per-GPU proven), and og:description prints "$1.99/GPU/hour"
    (per-hour + USD proven). NEVER multiply by specs_per_node.gpu_count -- the
    raw figure is already the per-GPU rate (gpu_count_basis=1).
  - the payload carries no currency field; USD is pinned from the provider's
    own dollar prints (pricing FAQ "starting at $1.99", og:description above)
    which exactly match the ethernet figure. The InfiniBand figure has NO
    static human-readable confirmation -- the marketing card says "Contact for
    pricing" -- but it renders through the same dashboard USD price path (zod
    schema + deploy-flow minPrice), noted per-observation in extra.
  - prices arrive as JSON strings today but the app schema accepts
    number-or-string, so parsing goes through Decimal(str(x)) and tolerates a
    type flip without loosening the >0 pin.

Fail-closed identity pins (every one earned by a near-miss):

  - top level must carry a 'results' list and 'total_result_count' int, the
    page must be complete (has_next falsy AND total == len(results)) -- one
    page today (total_result_count=1); if pagination ever activates this
    collector raises rather than silently under-reporting;
  - per row, specs_per_node.gpu_model must be a non-empty string and BOTH
    price fields must Decimal-parse > 0; any missing/renamed field raises with
    zero rows recorded. gpu_count_ethernet/gpu_count_infiniband are numeric
    LOOKALIKES for the price fields (and sat at 0 while prices stayed live at
    probe time), so availability never gates a price and the pin is on the
    exact price field names;
    (the counts are no longer MERE lookalikes -- since 2026-08-25 they are
    one leg of the corroborated 4-surface availability signal below -- but
    the price pin stays on the exact price field names regardless);
  - any UNKNOWN row key containing 'gpu_price' raises: a new price column
    (a spot tier, a reserved price going public) is a published price this
    recipe never saw -- same refuse-to-under-report rule as pagination;
  - churn risk is real (Lightning AI merger announced, TensorDock acquired,
    numeric pricing already pulled from the marketing site) -- these pins are
    the tripwire.

Availability capture (availability accrual, added 2026-08-25) -- three legs:

  - Rung 1: each bare-metal row also carries two reserved-capacity fields,
    reserved_gpu_count_infiniband_cluster_one/_two (nullable ints per the
    live openapi.json; both null 2026-08-25). Recorded verbatim into extra
    next to available_gpu_count -- nulls as-is, and like every availability
    field here they NEVER gate a price.
  - Rung 2: two more unauthenticated GETs per collect() run land verbatim
    in book_stats["vm_instant"]: /api/v1/instant-deploy-presets/ (4 H100 VM
    presets 2026-08-25, each with location_ids_with_availability -- the
    location UUIDs with stock RIGHT NOW -- plus per-INSTANCE hourly rates:
    "15.120000" is the 8-GPU preset, NEVER a per-GPU price) and
    /api/v1/virtual-machines/instant/locations (the spec's durable,
    non-deprecated replacement: rows carry available_presets[].available_vms
    integers; empty page 2026-08-25). The presets endpoint is DEPRECATED in
    the spec -- churn expected; prefer available_vms long-term.
  - Semantics are CLAIMED availability until a nonzero print lands: every
    field on every surface read 0/empty at both probes (2026-08-22 and
    2026-08-25) while prices stayed published. Four surfaces reading empty
    SIMULTANEOUSLY (gpu_count_*=0, all location_ids_with_availability=[],
    instant locations results=[], legacy /locations/ results=[]) corroborate
    "sold out" over junk fields, but a zero reading is not yet PROVEN to
    mean sold out -- every surface here is read anonymously, and the first
    nonzero observation is the semantics proof.

The VM surfaces do NOT emit observations (2026-08-25 ruling): voltagepark
is a seated source in the live H100 panels, which read raw-observatory
observations -- new 1x-H100 preset price rows (~$1.89/GPU-hr) would change
the seat's lowest-eligible print, a live-index composition change out of
scope for availability accrual. Preset prices ride as book_stats metadata
only. Both VM fetches are FAIL-OPEN (partial_errors) so a VM-surface
failure or reshape can never dark the proven bare-metal price lane; the
parse fences within each VM surface stay fail-closed and surface through
the same partial_errors channel.

Do NOT scrape the marketing /pricing page (it carries no numeric prices;
cards say "Contact for pricing"; $1.99 lives only in meta tags/FAQ
prose). Account-scoped surfaces exist and are out of scope.
