"""OVHcloud -- public no-auth order-catalog JSON, both billing subsidiaries.

Four GETs per capture: two cloud price catalogs (fetch count fixed by the
configured subsidiary list, capped at MAX_SUBSIDIARIES) plus two dedicated-
server availability books (fixed, see below -- a deliberate renegotiation
of the original two-GET budget for the availability-accrual
lane). The cloud catalogs: the FR
book on api.ovh.com (bills EUR; the full GPU lineup incl. H100/H200/A100)
and the SEPARATE US legal entity's book on api.us.ovhcloud.com (bills USD;
L4/L40S/V100S only -- a genuinely smaller lineup, not a parse failure).
The two entities publish different
lineups AND different prices, so every observation is pinned to its book:
``locale.currencyCode`` and ``locale.subsidiary`` from the same response
must equal the per-endpoint expectation or the whole book RAISES -- prices
must never be recorded under the wrong currency/entity. (A third,
world-English price book exists behind www.ovhcloud.com/en/ -- deliberately
not fetched; cross-checks must be same-subsidiary.)

Row fence (identity pin, fail-closed): only addons with
``blobs.commercial.brick == "gpu"`` are GPU *instance rental* rows. The
brick pin -- not gpu-blob presence -- is load-bearing: ``ai-*`` managed-
service addons (AI Deploy/Training under brick "ai-serving") carry a full
``blobs.technical.gpu`` spec but are priced PER MINUTE, and would poison
the record as ~60x-cheap hourly prints if the fence were "has a gpu blob".
Within the brick, a row needs ``blobs.technical.gpu.model`` (the provider's
structured part label -> sku_identifier) and ``.gpu.number`` (the per-GPU
divisor); rows missing either are skipped into partial_errors, never
guessed.

Price semantics verified live 2026-08-22:

  - ``pricings[].price`` is an integer in 1e-8 currency units (280000000 =
    2.80). TRIPWIRE per row: price/1e8 must agree with the row's own
    ``formattedPrice`` display string to the half-cent -- the display is
    rounded to 2 decimals (win-t2-45 US: 155819000 -> 1.55819 shown as
    "$1.56 USD"), so the check is a tolerance, not equality. A row whose
    two figures disagree (scale convention broken) is failed, never
    rescaled. Prices are ex-VAT (``tax`` is a separate field), matching
    OVH's own "HT" display;
  - tier comes from the planCode billing-mode suffix, NOT from
    intervalUnit: US rows publish intervalUnit "none"/interval 0 on BOTH
    hourly-consumption AND some monthly rows (win-l4-*.monthly.postpaid),
    so intervalUnit is unreliable in both directions. ``*.consumption`` =
    hourly on-demand; ``*.monthly.postpaid`` = the monthly rate, recorded
    as monthly-commit and normalized at 730 h/month (the lane-wide
    convention); any other suffix is skipped+noted, never guessed;
  - ``win-*`` flavors are the same hardware at Windows-license-included
    prices (t2-45 US 0.88 vs win-t2-45 1.56/hr) -- recorded, labeled via
    the structured ``blobs.technical.os.family`` field (notes +
    extra.windows_license_included), never mixed silently with Linux rows;
  - ``t1-le-*``/``t2-le-*`` are legacy flavor variants of t1/t2 (usually
    identical prices; US monthly diverges) -- all recorded as separate
    plan_code rows, flagged extra.legacy_le_variant for dedupe-aware
    consumers;
  - some rows are tagged "coming_soon" with a published price (A10 and
    Quadro-RTX5000 on FR today) -- recorded with blobs.tags in extra so
    consumers can screen;
  - "Quadro-RTX5000" is the Turing-era Quadro card, NOT an RTX 5000
    Ada/5090 -- the model string rides through verbatim and the catalog
    decides (today it maps to the Turing RTX_5000 entry, which sits below
    RTX_5000_ADA exactly to keep this label off the Ada part).

Baremetal GPU availability (availability accrual, live evidence 2026-08-25): two more
GETs per capture read the dedicated-server availability books -- the EU
entity's on api.ovh.com (8,973 entries, 169 with a "gpu" hardware part,
4.33 MB) and the US entity's on api.us.ovhcloud.com (15,129 entries, 319
gpu, 6.34 MB -- 76% of the transport cap, so both books ride the same
_BODY_CAP_WARN_FRACTION tripwire as the FR catalog). Fetched UNFILTERED:
the server-side ?gpu= filter is verified working but drift-blind (a
filtered fetch can never surface a NEW gpu part name), so we filter
client-side on a truthy "gpu" key. Two landing channels:

  - book_stats["dedicated_gpu_availability"][EU|US] holds the verbatim
    GPU rows (fqn, planCode, gpu, datacenters[{datacenter, availability}])
    so nothing is dropped when a part has no cloud twin (V100S, RX6700XT
    today);
  - cloud observations whose blobs.technical.gpu.model matches a parsed
    baremetal part model (L4 and L40S today; gpu-{N}x{vendor}-{model}
    [-{mem}g] -> gpu_count + label, tesla-v100s -> V100S) get
    extra.dedicated_gpu_availability -- per-part {gpu_part, gpu_count,
    plan_codes, per_datacenter: {dc: {state: config count}}}, EU-vs-US
    deduped by fqn+datacenter BEFORE the rollup (the US book carries
    -eu/-ca plan variants) -- plus an explicit
    extra.dedicated_availability_product_line = "baremetal": this signal
    covers BAREMETAL GPU only; the Public Cloud GPU flavors priced above
    have NO availability surface at all (OVH staff confirmed none exists
    even authenticated), so baremetal stock must never be read as
    cloud-instance stock.

Availability-state semantics are inferred from OVH's order funnel, NOT
documented in the response: 1H-low/1H-high ~ deliverable within ~1h at
low/high stock depth; NNNH lead-time buckets (72H, 240H, 720H, 1440H all
live 2026-08-25); plus unavailable/comingSoon/unknown. "unknown" dominates
the eu-west-par-a/b/c local-zone rows (145 of 522 EU GPU dc-states) --
recorded verbatim, the consumer decides whether unknown means unavailable.
A string outside this vocabulary is noted in partial_errors (once per
distinct string per book) and still recorded, never failed. Empty
datacenters lists are REAL (all 94 23scalegpu0*-v1-eu US L4 configs live
2026-08-25): recorded verbatim, zero rollup contribution, no note. The
whole availability channel is fail-open per the lane ruling -- fetch or
parse failure of either book lands in partial_errors and drops that book
only, price rows are never gated -- while WITHIN the parse the book-level
fences stay fail-closed (non-list payload, zero gpu rows, duplicate fqn
all RAISE into that book's partial_error).

Transport trap: the FR body is ~8.14 MB -- 97% of gpu_index.common.http's
MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES (8 MiB). Catalog growth of ~3% will make the fetch
refuse the body and fail this source loudly (fail-closed, never truncated);
book_stats records body_bytes per book and a partial_error fires above 85%
of the cap so the drift is visible in every capture before it breaks.
