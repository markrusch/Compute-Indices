"""Shared helpers for observatory collectors — the collector contract.

Contract per collector module (gpu_index/observatory/sources/<source_id>.py):

  - defines SOURCE_ID (== its module name) and
    collect(timeout=..., options=None) -> the result dict built by
    ``result`` below;
  - records EVERY GPU rental price row its surface publishes that the
    recipe can extract with an identity pin — all chips, all vendors, all
    tiers (labeled) — never just one target sku. Rows the recipe cannot
    pin safely are SKIPPED (and, where countable, noted in partial_errors)
    rather than guessed;
  - every observation carries the RAW value as published plus our per-GPU
    normalization and an explicit currency — a non-USD list price is
    recorded natively (price_usd_gpu_hr stays None), never mislabeled;
  - sets sku_identifier to the provider's own structured label; the
    FRAMEWORK derives the canonical sku from the catalog — collectors
    never claim a sku themselves, so one normalization rule governs every
    source and can be re-derived from raw later;
  - raises on failure INCLUDING parsed-nothing: a page that silently
    changed shape must surface as an error in the snapshot, never as a
    healthy source with zero prints;
  - TLS verification is never weakened, and collectors never aggregate
    across sources or write anywhere.

Transport comes from gpu_index.common.http (fetch) — the hardened stack (https-only
redirects, body caps, certifi bundle) is shared lane machinery, not basket
policy.
