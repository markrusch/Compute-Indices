"""EU-CRI index calculation (methodology-hashed: changes require a version bump).

Pure functions — no database access — so the whole calculation is golden-file testable.
Implements METHODOLOGY.md §3 exactly.

v0.3.0 aggregates over **offers**, not over one representative price per provider. That
single change is what makes the estimator sound. A weighted median over ~6 providers has
∂I/∂p = 1 for exactly one constituent and 0 for every other, and steps discontinuously when
the 50% crossing point moves between names — measured on the real panel, +10% on four of six
constituents moved the print by 0.00%. A weighted median over many GPU-count-weighted offers
is the SOFR construction: dense enough to be locally smooth, and it always lands on a price
someone actually quoted (which, on this bimodal panel, a mean provably does not — the mean
falls in the empty interval between the neocloud and hyperscaler clusters).

Concentration is controlled in two stages so density does not become capture:
offers are weighted by capacity within a provider, then each provider's *aggregate* share
is capped and redistributed pro-rata, then that share is spread back over its offers.
