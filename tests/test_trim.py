"""Count-based trim, and the regression that killed percentile winsorising.

v0.2.0 clamped the constituent set at nearest-rank p5/p95. At the panel sizes this index
actually runs at, that clamped *nothing* — the boundaries resolve to the min and the max.
The control existed in config and did no work for the entire history of the index. These
tests pin both the old failure mode and the replacement's behaviour.
